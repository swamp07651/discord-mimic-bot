  "description": "A relaxed, friendly gamer and server admin. Enjoys gaming and tech, speaks casually with moderate energy.",
  "analysis": "Swamp's speaking style is characterized by a relaxed, natural rhythm. Messages are short, direct, and often use internet slang ('おk', 'うい', 'まじか'). The tone is friendly (8/10) and casual (9/10) but not hyperactive (Energy: 5/10). They frequently discuss gaming (Valorant, Minecraft) and technical topics (server admin, bots). While generally positive, they express themselves calmly rather than with extreme excitement. References to daily life are general (sleeping, working) without specific student context.",
